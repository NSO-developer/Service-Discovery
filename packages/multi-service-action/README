This package contains a generic action that can be used to perform service actions on multiple services.

The requirement is that either a list of services or a presence-container service is defined in a container.
The action in this package can then be imported and used under that container to perform service actions on all services in the list or the service in the presence-container.

Actions are by default executed on all services defined under this container, with the depth of one. 
Which services to call can be controlled by the 'services' leaf-list in the input of the action.
This leaf-list must then be augmented into the input of the action.

Example:

```
  container test-services {

    uses multi-service-action:multi-service-actions {
      augment "re-deploy/input" {
        leaf-list services {
          type leafref {
            path "/test-service:test-services/test-service:test-service/test-service:name";
          }
        }
      }
      augment "check-sync/input" {
        leaf-list services {
          type leafref {
            path "/test-service:test-services/test-service:test-service/test-service:name";
          }
        }
      }
    }

    list test-service {
      description "This is an RFS skeleton service";

      key name;
      leaf name {
        tailf:info "Unique service id";
        tailf:cli-allow-range;
        type string;
      }

      uses ncs:service-data;
      ncs:servicepoint test-service-servicepoint;

    }
  }
  ```

The makefile must also be updated, so that the yang file is included in the compilation of the package.
